# SmartCoffeeMachine

Please look at the final report on the needed tools and a description on the project. The code is one file and the enitire program runs sequentially with no interrupts. 

The Machine was integrated with the following sensors along with the Tiva Launchpad by Texas Instruments:
* A Digital Counter(LED Display): Indicates number of coffees left that could be made 
*	An ultrasound sensor: Detects the water level left which helps indicate how much cups we can still do
*	A buzzer: to indicate when the coffee was done. 
*	A knob: to control the volume of the buzzer
*	A WIFI-sensor: Which allowed the coffe machine to become a remote sever. Allowed users to order the coffee online
